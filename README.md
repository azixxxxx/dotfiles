### HELLO, GNU/LINUX COMMUNITY ###

That's my simple KDE setup, that can be done on any distro, especially if you're using KDE.

Here's how to setup the KDE themes:
1) Go to system settings;
2) Open "Colors & Themes" tab;
3) Open Colors tab and click on "Get New..." button, then search for GruvboxColors;
4) THen open Icons tab and click on "Get New..." button, search for Gruvbox Plus Dark;

If you want to use a dock like mine, you should click the right-mouse button on your bottom panel -> "Show Panel configuration" -> Delete everything except icons and application dashboard -> configure the width on panel settings to fit content and if you want it to minimize after maximizing windows ->  configure the visibility to Dodge Windows.

Topbar configuration: Add new empty pannel to the top -> add to spacers -> add widgets: digital clock + system tray -> move your clock to the center between 2 spacers and system tray to the right by dragging it.

Alacritty configuration: create directory Alacritty in ~/.config/ you can use terminal command 
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/.config/alacritty
```
Move my config to this directory, you can make the same thing with Fastfetch.
